# LifeIsSadness

>Time stops And stands still\ Each day \ Seems like a year\ I'm lost \ And can't be found\ In this darkness\ lay dying\ Cold\ >Empty\ And alone\ It holds me down\ And won't let go\ There is no escaping\ it consumes me\ until there's nothing left\ I >may look fine\ But on the inside I'm full of death\
